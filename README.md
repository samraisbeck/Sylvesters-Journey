# Sylvesters-Journey
First ever game, from back in grade 11. I might add a few things to it but mainly I
put this up just so others can enjoy it if they like, and so I know where it is.

### To Play
Just clone the repo in, navigate to it, and `python runGame.py`. Hitting
Ctrl+F toggles fullscreen mode. The rest of the instructions should be in the
game and the menus.

Also make sure you have pygame by doing `pip install pygame`. This is for
Python 2.7 as well.
