The levels are created using file i/o with text documents.
The numbers for the first three sets are for, in order:


The numbers indicate:

x-coord, y-coord, width, height

For the fourth set, this is data for the enemies. The numbers indicate:

x-coord, y-coord, speed, damage potential, health

*Note: Try to put all objects (platforms, enemies, etc) in order based on their x-coordinate.
That is, starting with the platform right under the spawn of the character, and moving right.
Damage potential indicates the enemy type. So far, a damage of 5 is the small enemy, damage of 10 is the upright enemy.

Power/Item blocks go 150 higher than the platform.

Small black enemy should be 20 higher than the platform it is on (so 20 less y-units).
Taller green enemy should be 45 higher than the platform it is on (so 45 less y-units).
Boss enemies should be 70 higher than the platform it is on (so 70 less y-units).
Walls are 700 tall, and 120 wide.
When stacking walls on top of each other, the other one should be 700-15 higher than the other. So, the y of the first one, subtract (700-15) for the y of the second one.
